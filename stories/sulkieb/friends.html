			<h2>Special Friends</h2>
			<h3>Renee “Nene” Bellerose</h3>
			<p>I first met Nene in 1493 while travelling west. I helped her find her spellbook and then I ran away. Later I realised that I made a mistake and we met up again.</p>
			<p>Now I live together with Nene and Breadstick and we even work at the same company.</p>
			<p>Being with Nene makes me feel warm and happy.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Close Friends</h2>
			<h3>Jurian “J” Frayle</h3>
			<p>Big sister Jurian took me in when I was living on the streets and took care of me. That’s why she’ll always be my big sister. She even gave me the feather in my hat.</p>
			<p>I lived together with J for a long time but after Nene came to town I moved into a different room. It was good living with J though and I miss her but don’t tell her I said that.</p>
			<h3>Breadstick</h3>
			<p>Breadstick is my cat. Breadstick is grey and stripy and has a stubby tail.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Best Friends</h2>
			<h3>K’Thexsis “Thexy”</h3>
			<p>Thexy is a mysterious person who likes blue and also maybe green. She is strange but in a nice way. I haven’t seen her in a while so I hope she’s doing well.</p>
			<h3>Aekeek “Kiki”</h3>
			<p>Kiki is made of feathers and taught me how to read maps and we drew pictures together. He can fly which is amazing but also scary because what if he falls? I wonder, but it hasn’t happened yet.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Other Friends</h2>
			<h3>Lady Joey Beestinger</h3>
			<p>I don’t know much about Joey but I think she said we’re cousins. I’m not sure what that means but it could be important someday so I remembered it.</p>
