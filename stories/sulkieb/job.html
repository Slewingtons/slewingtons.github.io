			<p class="overview">I work for a company called <em>Timothy’s Fleet Feet Pickup & Delivery.</em></p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Safe Delivery Guarantee</h2>
			<p>Fleet Feet delivers packages to people in the city and some of the packages are dangerous. That’s why we have the <em>Safe Delivery Guarantee.</em> The Safe Delivery Guarantee means that every package we deliver is guaranteed to be safe, or if it isn’t it has a red sticker on it.</p>
			<p>We have a whole department of wizards who check for dangerous magic spells and put red stickers on the dangerous packages.</p>
			<p>When Timothy was in charge couriers were considered “expendable” but Nene put a stop to that.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>My Role</h2>
			<p>I am the number one courier in the company and the <strong>courier supervisor.</strong> I deliver packages and I also assign packages to other couriers.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2>Employees</h2>
			<h3>Timothy</h3>
			<p>Timothy is a <strong>strange man</strong> who might still own the company but we haven’t seen him in years.</p>
			<p>When I first joined the company Timothy made us work a seven day “week” even though everyone else uses a tenday.</p>
			<p>What a strange man.</p>
			<h3>Nene</h3>
			<p>Nene used to work in the sorting department until Timothy left and she became the <strong>general manager.</strong> She is very good at her job and everyone says so.</p>
			<p>We are special friends but when we are at work we are “professional” which means we don’t hold hands unless it’s an emergency.</p>
			<p>Nene has black curly hair and she’s a wizard.</p>
			<h3>Symphony</h3>
			<p>Symphony is a bureaumancer and the <strong>sorting supervisor.</strong></p>
			<p>She wears spectacles and ties her hair in a “bun” except when she “lets loose” and “goes wild.” She wants to run her own branch of Fleet Feet someday.</p>
			<p>I’ve been told that she is “half of an elf” but I don’t know what that means.</p>
			<h3>Willoughby</h3>
			<p>Willoughby is our friendly <strong>staff cleric.</strong> He heals any of the couriers who get injured on the job.</p>
			<p>He always looks tired and has a huge floppy wizard hat and also he never speaks. Nene invented a spell that gives him “subtitles” so we can understand him.</p>
			<p>Willoughby is an elf and has pointy ears.</p>
			<h3>Luza</h3>
			<p>Luza is the <strong>treasurer</strong> who guards Fleet Feet’s money.</p>
			<p>It’s very difficult to get Luza to pay people’s wages. You have to let her pay herself at the same time or she thinks it’s not fair.</p>
			<p>She is a little magic lizard girl.</p>
			<h3>Elwood</h3>
			<p>Elwood is our <strong>doorman.</strong> He was the first ever courier to work at Fleet Feet back when Timothy started it.</p>
			<p>Because of an accident Elwood has been trapped inside our front door for years now. Nene is working on a spell to free him.</p>
			<h3>Breadstick</h3>
			<p>Breadstick is my cat but Nene said Breadstick can also be the <strong>company mascot.</strong></p>
