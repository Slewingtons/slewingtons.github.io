			<p>I am very tall. I am almost four feet tall (3′ 11″) so people often mistake me for a human. <strong>Nene</strong> is only 3′ 2″ but I don’t mind.</p>
			<p>I have a cat named <strong>Breadstick.</strong> I called Breadstick Breadstick because I like breadsticks and I also like Breadstick the cat. Breadstick is grey and stripy and has a stubby tail. Breadstick sleeps a lot.</p>
			<p>I came from a village in the East but now I live in a city by the sea. I work as a courier for a company called <em>Timothy’s Fleet Feet Pickup and Delivery.</em> I think Timothy still owns the company but he is a strange man and we haven’t seen him in years so Nene runs the company now.</p>
			<p>I have a musical instrument called <strong>Rebecca.</strong> She has three strings and a bow. Breadstick didn’t like the sound when I first started playing Rebecca but now I’m much better.</p>
